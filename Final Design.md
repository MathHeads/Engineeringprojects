<li>a)Description</li>
For our project we developed an egg incubator. The eggs sit inbetween wooden rods and the entire component is pushed and pulled by the motor 4 inches each direction. The eggs need to be turned for 18 out of the 21 day style so that the embryo will remain in the center of the egg until the chick has mostly developed. The incubator regulates the temperature at around 100 degrees Fahrenheit with the heat lamp.
