<li>a)Description</li>
For our project we developed an egg incubator. The eggs sit inbetween wooden rods and the entire component is pushed and pulled by the motor 4 inches each direction. The eggs need to be turned for 18 out of the 21 day style so that the embryo will remain in the center of the egg until the chick has mostly developed. The incubator regulates the temperature at around 100 degrees Fahrenheit with the heat lamp.

<li>c)Manufacturing Process</li>

<ul>

<b>Structure</b>
<li>Base: Solid piece 30x30 inches
<li>Sides: nailed into place, 30x24 inches
<li>Front has double acrylic window, hinges on left side, latch on right side
<li>Back has motor connected at the bottom, arduino connected on outside, power strip on outside
<li>Sides have small ventilation holes at the bottom
<li>Top: Two seperate pieces, Heat lamp bolted on</li>


<b>Electrical</b>
<li>Arduino controlled system: controls egg turner and heat lamp
<li>Heat Lamp: turns on below 95 degrees and turns off above 105 degrees Fahrenheit
<li>Motor: turns off after 18 days</li>
