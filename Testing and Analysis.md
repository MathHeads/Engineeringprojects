7. Testing and Analysis
========================

<b>a) Critical Parts</b>

<ul>

<li>Egg turner: box with wooden rodes accross
<li>Eggs fit between the rodes
<li>Fits around 70 eggs
<li>Blips on bottom to reduce friction</li>
<li>Motor: Connects to egg turner
<li>Pushes and pulls the egg turner 4 inches both ways
<li>Continuously turns eggs
<li>One rotation every 4 hours
<li>Stops after 18 days
<li>Specifically for turning eggs</li>


</ul>

<b>b) Analysis in design</b>

<ul>

Measurements
<li>Size of entire box
<li>Size of arduino box
<li>Size of egg turner
<li>Length of motor attatchments
<li>Height of attatched motor
<li>Placement of window
<li>Size of acrylic for window
<li>Placement of hinges
<li>Placement of latch components
<li>Placement of arduino box relative to power strip</li>

</ul>

<b>c) User Testing</b>

<ul>

<li>Minimal user testing
<li>Animal Testing and Breeding Policy: Unable to use real chicken eggs
<li>Requires at least 18 days to test the motor
<li>Did not finish with enough time for a full trial
<li>Know that the motor works from design expo
<li>Saw the motor move almost all the way around since the incubator was on the whole day</li>

</ul>
