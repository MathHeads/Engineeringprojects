<b>2. Background/client information</b>
 
<ul>
Client: Andrew Houssney
 <li>Owns Jacob Springs Farm
 <li>Needs an efficiet incubator to hatch chicken eggs (100-300 eggs at a time)</li>
 <li>Wants to be notified of the temperature and humidity of the incubator through an app or remote</li>
 <li>Wants to be able to turn on/off the heat lamp in the incubator using his phone or a remote</li>
 <li>Wants to have an automated system so he doesn't need to check incubator every day.</li>
 
 </ul>

<b>3. Design Requirements</b>

<ul>
 
 <li>The final product will be an egg incubator that holds 100-300 eggs at a time</li>
 <li>Will maintain temperature of 99.5-101.5 degrees fahrenheit depending on the type of incubator we build</li>
 <li>Will maintain a 40-50% humidity </li>
 <li>Will turn eggs 3-5 times a day for the first 18 days of incubation</li>
 <li>Will NOT turn eggs on last three days</li>
 <li>Arudino will be able to communicate wirelessly with an app on farmer's phone</li>
 <li>Farmer will be able to see and control temperature and humidiity by remote or phone app</li>
 
</ul>

<b>4. Design alternatives</b>
 
<ul>

 <li>We were deciding between fixing the incubation issue, freezer and fridge issue, and greenhouse issue</li>
 <li>Might use a phone app or a remote for communication/notification</li>
 <li>Many things we can make the chamber out of: styrofoam, metal, wood, etc.</li>
 <li>Many ways to turn eggs inside the chamber: Automation, notify farmer, roll eggs with mechanism, etc.</li>
 
 </ul>
