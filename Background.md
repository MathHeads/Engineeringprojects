<b>2. Background/client information</b>
 
<ul>
Client: Andrew Houssney
 <li>Owns Jacob Springs Farm: Diversified, Organic Farm
 
Concept: Hatchery 5000
 <li>Incubator to hatch chicken eggs

 <li>Maintain a 40-50% humidity </li>
 <li>Turn eggs 3-5 times a day for 18 out of the 21 days of incubation</li>
 <li>Will NOT turn eggs on last three days</li>
 <li>Arudino will be able to communicate wirelessly with an app on farmer's phone</li>
 <li>Farmer will be able to see and control temperature and humidiity by remote or phone app</li>
 
</ul>

<b>4. Design alternatives</b>
 
<ul>


 <li>Many things to work on at his farm: chicken hatchery, freezer and fridge controls, and greenhouse regulation, chicken coop door, or irrigation</li>
 <li>Different ways to notify farmer: phone app or a remote</li>
