===================
Background/client information
 -Andrew Houssney
 -Owns Jacob Springs Farm
 -Needs an efficiet incubator to hatch chicken eggs (100-300 eggs at a time)
 -Wants to be notified of the temperature and humidity of the incubator through an app or remote
 -Wants to be able to turn on/off the heat lamp in the incubator using his phone or a remote

Design Requirements
 -The final product will be an egg incubator that holds 100-300 eggs at a time
 -Will maintain temperature of 99.5-101.5 degrees fahrenheit depending on the type of incubator we build
 -Will maintain a 40-50% humidity 
 -Will turn eggs 3-5 times a day for the first 18 days of incubation
 -Farmer will be able to see and control temperature and humidiity by remote or phone app

Design alternatives
 -We were deciding between fixing the incubation issue, freezer and fridge issue, and greenhouse issue
 -Might use a phone app or a remote
 -Many things we can make the chamber out of
 -Many ways to turn eggs inside the chamber
