===================
2. Background/client information
 
 -Andrew Houssney
 
 -Owns Jacob Springs Farm
 
 -Needs an efficiet incubator to hatch chicken eggs (100-300 eggs at a time)
 
 -Wants to be notified of the temperature and humidity of the incubator through an app or remote
 
 -Wants to be able to turn on/off the heat lamp in the incubator using his phone or a remote
 
 -Wants to have an automated system so he doesn't need to check incubator every day.

3. Design Requirements
 
 -The final product will be an egg incubator that holds 100-300 eggs at a time
 
 -Will maintain temperature of 99.5-101.5 degrees fahrenheit depending on the type of incubator we build
 
 -Will maintain a 40-50% humidity 
 
 -Will turn eggs 3-5 times a day for the first 18 days of incubation
 
 -Will NOT turn eggs on last three days
 
 -Arudino will be able to communicate wirelessly with an app on farmer's phone
 
 -Farmer will be able to see and control temperature and humidiity by remote or phone app

4. Design alternatives
 
 -We were deciding between fixing the incubation issue, freezer and fridge issue, and greenhouse issue
 
 -Might use a phone app or a remote for communication/notification
 
 -Many things we can make the chamber out of: styrofoam, metal, wood, etc.
 
 -Many ways to turn eggs inside the chamber: Automation, notify farmer, roll eggs with mechanism, etc.
