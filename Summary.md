<b> The objective of this project was to create an egg incubator for a local farmer that holds around 100 eggs.</b>
<b> The requirements for the egg turner were:</b>
<li> It must hold around 100 eggs</li>
<li> It must turn the eggs for 18 days</li>
<li> It must keep a constant temperature at 100 degrees Fahrenheit<li/>
<b> The final tested and analyzed project was a 30"x30"x24" bubble wrap insulated egg incubator with:</b>
<li> A heat lamp hooked up to an arduino coded to turn on when the temperature got below 95 degrees and turn off when the temperature got above 105 degrees</li>
<li> A motor that pushes and pulls a device that turns the eggs for 18 days and then turns off</li>
