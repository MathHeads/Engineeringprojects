Critical-Component
==================
For our critical component, we chose the egg turner. 
Our motor is a hovabator egg turner replacement motor. It makes a slow 360 degree revolution every 4 hours.
There was no code necessary for this motor. 
We made two arms connected to the motor. The two arms connected makes a movement with the trner that pulls the eggs back and forth.
The wooden structure that the motor pulls provides room for 70 eggs.
