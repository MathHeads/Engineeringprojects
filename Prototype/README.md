Prototype
=========

<b>Construction Process</b>

<ul>

<b>Materials</b>
<li>Insulated box for incubator structure</li>
<li>wood for egg turner bars and platform</li>
<li>arduino</li>
<li>temperature and humidity sensor</li>
<li>heat lamp</li>
<li>servo</li>
<li>servo connector to attach to turner</li>

</ul>

<b>Coding</b> 

<ul>

Clayton
<li>worked on coding for the temperature settings</li>
<li>the incubator will always be 100 degrees fehrenheit</li>

Jean
<li>set up the temperature sensor, which is hooked up to the arduino</li>
<li>the heat lamp will turn on when the temperature falls below 95 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
<li>the heat lamp will turn off when the temperature rises above 105 degrees Fahrenheit</li>

Nikki
<li>made a code for the servo to turn the eggs</li>
<li>The original intention was for the servo to turn 180 degrees very slowly every six hours</li>
<li>When we tested the prototype, the servo turned 180 degrees and then immediately back about every 2 minutes</li>
<li>This is one thing we will have to fix for the final.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<b>Egg turning</b>

Ellie
<li>built two platforms for eggs to lay</li>
<li>built bars that hook up to the servo that push the eggs in order for them to turn</li>
She built them according to average egg size. We expect to build bigger platforms with more bars to push the eggs for the final. Nikki set up the servo to the bars in order for them to move. The servo spins 180 degrees, and then back. This pushes the bars back and forth in order for the eggs to turn. In our prototype, the bars only move about 3/4 inches, but for our final we will have a bigger attachment to the servo in order so that the bars will move 2-3 inches. The bars must move 2-3 inches so that the egg will turn at lest 45 degrees each time the servo turns on.</li>
<li>Critical component is the egg turner connected to the servo</li>

</ul>
