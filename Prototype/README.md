Prototype
=========

<b>Construction Process</b>

<b>Materials</b>

<ul>

<li>Insulated box for incubator structure</li>
<li>wood for egg turner bars and platform</li>
<li>arduino</li>
<li>temperature and humidity sensor</li>
<li>heat lamp</li>
<li>servo</li>
<li>servo connector to attach to turner</li>

</ul>

<b>Coding</b> 

<ul>

Clayton
<li>worked on coding for the temperature settings</li>
<li>the incubator will always be 100 degrees fehrenheit</li>

Jean
<li>set up the temperature sensor, which is hooked up to the arduino</li>
<li>the heat lamp will turn on when the temperature falls below 95 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
<li>the heat lamp will turn off when the temperature rises above 105 degrees Fahrenheit</li>

Nikki
<li>made a code for the servo to turn the eggs</li>
<li>The original intention was for the servo to turn 180 degrees very slowly every six hours</li>
<li>When we tested the prototype, the servo turned 180 degrees and then immediately back about every 2 minutes</li>
<li>This is one thing we will have to fix for the final.</li>

</ul>

<b>Egg turning</b>

<ul>

Ellie
<li>built two platforms for eggs to lay</li>
<li>built bars that hook up to the servo that push the eggs in order for them to turn</li>
<li>according to average egg size</li>

</ul>

<b>Future</b>

<ul>
<li>build bigger platforms with more bars to push the eggs</li>
<li>Nikki set up the servo to the bars in order for them to move</li>
<li>the servo spins 180 degrees, and then back</li>
<li>This pushes the bars back and forth in order for the eggs to turn</li>
<li>In our prototype, the bars only move about 3/4 inches, but for our final we will have a bigger attachment to the servo in order so that the bars will move 2-3 inches</li>
<li>The bars must move 2-3 inches so that the egg will turn at lest 45 degrees each time the servo turns on.</li>
<li>Critical component is the egg turner connected to the servo</li>

</ul>
